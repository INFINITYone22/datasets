      "explanation": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) is not a single atom. An atom is the basic unit of a chemical element (like a single Na atom or a single Cl atom). Sodium chloride is formed when one atom of sodium (Na) chemically bonds with one atom of chlorine (Cl). This chemical bond is ionic, resulting from the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine, creating ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻) that are held together by electrostatic attraction. Because NaCl consists of two atoms bonded together, it fits the general definition of a molecule, which is a group of two or more atoms chemically joined. However, it's important to note that in its solid state, NaCl forms a crystal lattice structure—a repeating array of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions—rather than discrete, individual NaCl molecules like water (H₂O) or carbon dioxide (CO₂). For ionic compounds like NaCl, chemists often use the term 'formula unit' to represent the simplest whole-number ratio of ions in the crystal lattice. Nonetheless, when comparing NaCl to a single atom, it is clearly a multi-atom entity, appropriately classified as a compound represented by a formula unit or, in a broader sense, a molecule."

This shearing motion requires the medium to have elastic shear strength, meaning it can resist deformation and spring back. Solids possess shear strength, allowing S-waves to travel through them. Liquids and gases, however, lack significant shear strength; they flow rather than shearing elastically. Because Earth's outer core is composed of liquid molten metal, it cannot sustain the shearing motion of S-waves. Therefore, S-waves generated by earthquakes cannot penetrate the outer core. This observation is crucial evidence confirming that the outer core is liquid."

In large spaces like canyons or large halls, the walls or cliffs are far away, ensuring a long travel path and thus a noticeable delay. Furthermore, hard surfaces (like rock walls or bare plaster walls) reflect sound waves efficiently with minimal absorption. In contrast, a small room has reflecting surfaces that are very close, leading to very short delays between the direct sound and reflections (creating reverberation rather than distinct echoes).

Extremely high temperatures, such as boiling (100°C), provide enough thermal energy to disrupt the relatively weak bonds (like hydrogen bonds) that maintain the enzyme's specific 3D shape. This causes the enzyme to unfold and lose its functional conformation, a process called denaturation. A denatured enzyme loses the specific shape of its active site, can no longer bind effectively to its substrate, and thus loses its catalytic activity.

While the algae bioaccumulate the pesticide, the concentration might still be relatively low. However, when herbivores eat large quantities of algae, the pesticide accumulates in their tissues. When small fish eat the herbivores, they consume the accumulated pesticide from many individuals. This continues up the food chain. A fish-eating bird, being a top consumer, eats many fish, each containing accumulated pesticides. As a result, the concentration of the pesticide becomes progressively higher (magnified) at each successive trophic level.

      "explanation": "The colors of the visible light spectrum are arranged in order of wavelength (and inversely by frequency and energy). The common mnemonic ROYGBIV stands for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, representing the sequence from longest wavelength to shortest wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength (around 620-750 nanometers), and violet light has the shortest wavelength (around 380-450 nanometers). Green light falls in the middle of the spectrum (around 495-570 nanometers). Since green comes before violet in the ROYGBIV sequence when ordered from long to short wavelength, green light has a longer wavelength than violet light."

One of the fundamental tenets of cell theory is that all known living things are composed of one or more cells. Bacteria are single-celled organisms; each bacterium is a complete, self-contained cell with all the necessary components (like cytoplasm, ribosomes, genetic material) to carry out life processes, including metabolism and reproduction (typically by binary fission). This contrasts with entities like viruses, which lack a cellular structure and cannot reproduce independently, leading most biologists to classify them as non-living or on the borderline of life."

However, the time it takes for the Moon to cycle through its phases (e.g., from one New Moon to the next) is called the synodic period, which is about 29.5 days. The reason for the difference is that while the Moon is orbiting Earth, the Earth-Moon system is simultaneously orbiting the Sun. For the Moon to return to the same phase (e.g., New Moon, where it is between Earth and Sun), it needs to travel slightly more than 360 degrees around Earth to 'catch up' to the alignment with the Sun, which has shifted due to Earth's orbital motion. Therefore, the phase cycle (synodic period) is roughly 2.2 days longer than the orbital period relative to the stars (sidereal period)."

Its formation begins with the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks, which breaks them down into smaller particles, including sand-sized grains (typically 0.0625 to 2 millimeters in diameter). These sand grains are then transported by wind, water, or ice and eventually deposited in layers in environments like beaches, deserts, rivers, or oceans. Over time, as more sediment accumulates on top, the lower layers become buried. The weight of the overlying sediments compacts the sand grains together, reducing the space between them. Water containing dissolved minerals percolates through these spaces. These minerals precipitate out of the water and act as a natural cement (commonly silica, calcite, or iron oxide), binding the sand grains together into solid rock – sandstone."
