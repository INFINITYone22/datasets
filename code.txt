    "output": "The time complexity of searching for an element in a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) containing `n` elements is O(log n).\n\nExplanation:\nA BST has the property that for any given node, all values in its left subtree are smaller, and all values in its right subtree are larger. When searching for a target value, you start at the root. At each node, you compare the target value with the node's value. If they match, you've found the element. If the target is smaller, you only need to search the left subtree. If the target is larger, you only need to search the right subtree. In a *balanced* BST, the height of the tree is proportional to log n. Since each comparison effectively eliminates about half of the remaining nodes, the maximum number of comparisons needed is proportional to the height of the tree, resulting in O(log n) time complexity.",

In the worst-case scenario (where all items in the input list are unique), the set `seen` will store all `n` items.

They help avoid 'callback hell' (deeply nested callbacks).\n4.  **Chaining:** Promises can be chained using the `.then()` method. `.then()` takes two optional arguments: a callback for fulfillment and a callback for rejection. It returns a new Promise, allowing for sequential asynchronous operations.\n5.  **Error Handling:** Promises have a dedicated `.catch()` method for handling errors (rejections) that occur anywhere in the Promise chain, centralizing error management.\n6.  **Composability:** Methods like `Promise.all()` (wait for all Promises to fulfill) and `Promise.race()` (wait for the first Promise to settle) allow for managing multiple asynchronous operations together.\n\nIn essence, Promises make asynchronous code more readable, manageable, and less prone to errors by providing a standard interface for dealing with operations that don't complete immediately.",

    "input": "Find and fix the bug in this Python code snippet intended to remove all occurrences of a specific value `val` from a list `nums`.\n\n```python\ndef remove_value(nums, val):\n    # Problem: Modifying list while iterating over it\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] == val:\n            nums.pop(i) \n    return nums\n\n# Example Call (Problematic)\n# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]\n# remove_value(my_list, 2) -> Expected: [1, 3, 4], Actual: [1, 3, 4, 2]\n```",
    "output": "Bug Explanation:\nThe bug occurs because the code modifies the list (`nums.pop(i)`) while iterating over it using indices based on the *original* length and positions. When an item is removed using `pop(i)`, the list becomes shorter, and all subsequent elements shift one position to the left. However, the loop continues with the original indices, causing it to skip checking the element that shifted into the current index `i` after the removal.\n\nCorrected Code (Using list comprehension or creating a new list):\n```python\ndef remove_value_new_list(nums, val):\n    # Create a new list containing only the elements not equal to val\n    return [num for num in nums if num != val]\n```\n\nCorrected Code (Iterating backwards):\nIf modification *in-place* is strictly required (and efficiency is less critical than avoiding a new list), iterating backwards avoids the index shifting issue.\n```python\ndef remove_value_inplace_backward(nums, val):\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if nums[i] == val:\n            nums.pop(i)\n    return nums\n```\n\nCorrected Code (Using `while` loop and index carefulness - less pythonic):\n```python\ndef remove_value_while(nums, val):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(nums):\n        if nums[i] == val:\n            nums.pop(i)\n            # Do NOT increment i, as the next element has shifted to the current index\n        else:\n            i += 1 # Only increment if no removal occurred\n    return nums\n```",
    "reasoning_steps": [
      "1. **Understand the Goal:** Remove all instances of `val` from the list `nums`.",
      "2. **Analyze the Original Code:** The code iterates through the list using indices (`for i in range(len(nums))`) and removes elements using `nums.pop(i)` if they match `val`.",
      "3. **Identify the Problem:** Modifying a list (by removing elements) while iterating over it using indices derived from its original state is dangerous. When `nums.pop(i)` is called:\n    a. The list shrinks.\n    b. Elements after index `i` shift to the left (index `i+1` becomes `i`, `i+2` becomes `i+1`, etc.).\n    c. The loop increments `i` to `i+1` in the next iteration, but this now points to the element that was *originally* at index `i+2`, effectively skipping the element that shifted into the position `i`.",
      "4. **Illustrate with Example:** Trace `remove_value([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2], 2)`:\n    - `i=0`, `nums[0]=1`. No pop.\n    - `i=1`, `nums[1]=2`. Pop `nums[1]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 2, 4, 2]`. List length is now 5.\n    - `i=2`. The loop now checks `nums[2]`, which is now `2` (originally at index 3). It *should* have checked the `3` which shifted to index 1. Pop `nums[2]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 4, 2]`. List length 4.\n    - `i=3`. Loop checks `nums[3]`, which is now `2`. Pop `nums[3]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 4]`. List length 3.\n    - `i=4`. Loop condition `i < len(nums)` (original len was 6) continues, but index 4 is out of bounds for current list `[1, 3, 4]`. (Wait, the trace shows `range(len(nums))` is evaluated *once* at the start. So the range is `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. When `i=1`, pop `nums[1]`. `nums` = `[1, 3, 2, 4, 2]`. Loop proceeds to `i=2`. `nums[2]` is now `2`. Pop `nums[2]`. `nums` = `[1, 3, 4, 2]`. Loop proceeds to `i=3`. `nums[3]` is now `2`. Pop `nums[3]`. `nums` = `[1, 3, 4]`. Loop proceeds to `i=4`. `nums[4]` is out of bounds. Ah, the issue is skipping. Let's re-trace carefully:\n      - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]`, `range(6)`\n      - `i=0`: `nums[0]=1`. No pop.\n      - `i=1`: `nums[1]=2`. Pop `nums[1]`. `nums` is now `[1, 3, 2, 4, 2]`.\n      - `i=2`: Loop proceeds to index 2. `nums[2]` is `2`. Pop `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[1, 3, 4, 2]`.\n      - `i=3`: Loop proceeds to index 3. `nums[3]` is `2`. Pop `nums[3]`. `nums` is now `[1, 3, 4]`.\n      - `i=4`: Loop proceeds to index 4. Index is out of bounds for current list `[1, 3, 4]`. The loop likely terminates or errors depending on implementation details, but the core issue is the combination of index shifting and the loop counter incrementing independently. Example: If `nums = [2, 2, 3]`, `val = 2`. `i=0`, pop `nums[0]`. `nums = [2, 3]`. `i=1`, loop looks at `nums[1]` which is now `3`. It *skips* the second `2` which shifted to index 0.",
      "5. **Propose Fix 1 (New List):** The most Pythonic and safe way is to create a *new* list containing only the desired elements. List comprehension `[num for num in nums if num != val]` achieves this concisely.",
      "6. **Propose Fix 2 (Iterate Backwards):** If modifying in-place is required, iterate backwards (`range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1)`). Removing an element at index `i` does not affect the indices of elements *before* `i` that are yet to be visited.",
      "7. **Propose Fix 3 (While Loop):** Use a `while` loop with an index `i`. Only increment `i` when *no* element is removed. If an element is removed at `i`, the next element shifts into index `i`, so `i` should not be incremented in that step.",
      "8. **Choose Best Fix:** The list comprehension approach is generally preferred in Python for its clarity and safety."

It provides a way for functions/methods to access the properties and methods of the object they are associated with (the execution context).\n\nDetermination of `this` value:\nThe value of `this` is not static; it's determined dynamically at the time a function is *called* (runtime binding). The main ways `this` is determined are:\n\n1.  **Global Context:** When code is executed in the global scope (outside any function), `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js, or `undefined` in strict mode modules).\n2.  **Function Call (Default Binding):** When a regular function is called directly (not as a method of an object), `this` usually defaults to the global object (`window`/`global`). However, in strict mode (`'use strict'`), `this` will be `undefined` in this case.\n3.  **Method Invocation (Implicit Binding):** When a function is called as a method of an object (e.g., `myObject.myMethod()`), `this` inside `myMethod` refers to the object the method was called on (`myObject`).\n4.  **Constructor Call (New Binding):** When a function is called with the `new` keyword (e.g., `new MyConstructor()`), `this` inside the constructor function refers to the newly created object instance.\n5.  **Explicit Binding (`.call()`, `.apply()`, `.bind()`):** These methods allow you to explicitly set the value of `this` when calling a function.\n    *   `func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`: Calls `func` with `this` set to `thisArg`.\n    *   `func.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`: Calls `func` with `this` set to `thisArg`.\n    *   `func.bind(thisArg)`: Returns a *new* function that, when called, will have its `this` permanently bound to `thisArg`.\n6.  **Arrow Functions:** Arrow functions (`=>`) do *not* have their own `this` binding.

It usually involves combining the result of the recursive call with some other computation.\n\nExample: Sum of numbers from 1 to n (`sum(n)`)\n\n*   **Problem:** Calculate `1 + 2 + ... + n`.\n*   **Recursive Thinking:** The sum of numbers up to `n` can be defined as `n` plus the sum of numbers up to `n-1`.

This path has a depth of approximately `n` (e.g., `n -> n-1 -> n-2 -> ... -> 1`).\n  - Each function call occupies some space on the stack for its arguments, local variables, and return address.\n  - Therefore, the space complexity, driven by the recursion depth, is O(n).",

This leads to exponential growth in the total number of calls.\n    e. **Formalize:** The recurrence relation for the number of calls T(n) is roughly T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1).

    "output": "The Event Loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript's concurrency model, enabling non-blocking asynchronous operations despite JavaScript being single-threaded.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1.  **Call Stack:** JavaScript code execution happens on a single thread, managed by the call stack. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack. When it returns, it's popped off.\n2.  **Web APIs / C++ APIs:** Long-running operations (like `setTimeout`, DOM events, HTTP requests (fetch/XHR), file system operations in Node.js) are *not* handled directly by the JavaScript engine. They are handed off to browser Web APIs or Node.js's underlying C++ APIs, which can run them in parallel using separate threads managed by the system.\n3.  **Callback Queue (or Task Queue):** When an asynchronous operation (handled by the APIs) completes, its associated callback function (or Promise handler) is not executed immediately. Instead, it's placed onto a Callback Queue (also called Task Queue or Message Queue).\n4.  **Event Loop:** The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors two things: the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.\n    *   Its job is simple: If the Call Stack is *empty*, it takes the first task (callback function) from the Callback Queue (if one exists) and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution.\n5.  **Execution:** The callback function now runs like any other synchronous function on the call stack. It might itself make further asynchronous calls, repeating the cycle.\n\n**Why it matters:** This mechanism allows JavaScript to initiate long operations without blocking the main thread. While the API handles the I/O or timer in the background, the JavaScript thread can continue executing other code or remain responsive to user input. When the async operation is done, the event loop ensures its callback is eventually executed once the stack is clear.",

    "output": "Both `git merge` and `git rebase` are commands used to integrate changes from one Git branch into another. However, they do so in fundamentally different ways, resulting in different project histories.\n\n**`git merge`:**\n- **Action:** Takes all commits from a feature branch and merges them into the target branch (e.g., `main`) in a single new commit, called a 'merge commit'.\n- **History:** Preserves the original history of the feature branch exactly as it happened. The merge commit has two parents (the tip of the target branch and the tip of the feature branch), creating a diamond shape in the commit graph.\n- **Pros:** Non-destructive (doesn't rewrite history), preserves the exact context of the feature branch, easy to understand where branches diverged and merged.\n- **Cons:** Can lead to a cluttered, non-linear commit history with many merge commits, making it harder to follow the project's progression chronologically.\n- **Command:** `git checkout main; git merge feature_branch`\n\n**`git rebase`:**\n- **Action:** Takes all commits from a feature branch and 'replays' them, one by one, onto the tip of the target branch (e.g., `main`). It effectively moves the base of the feature branch to the target branch's current end.\n- **History:** Rewrites the commit history of the feature branch. The rebased commits are new commits with different SHA-1 hashes (even if the content is the same). The resulting history looks linear, as if the feature branch work started after the latest commit on the target branch.\n- **Pros:** Creates a cleaner, linear commit history, making it easier to follow the main line of development.\n- **Cons:** Rewrites history, which can be dangerous if the branch being rebased has already been shared/pushed (can cause issues for collaborators). Can make it harder to see exactly when feature work was done relative to the main branch. Conflicts need to be resolved commit-by-commit during the rebase process, which can be tedious.\n- **Command:** `git checkout feature_branch; git rebase main` (then potentially `git checkout main; git merge feature_branch` - often a fast-forward merge after rebase)\n\n**Summary:** Use `merge` for a non-destructive history that reflects the true branching structure. Use `rebase` (carefully, especially on unshared branches) to create a cleaner, linear history before merging.",

    "output": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where declarations of variables (`var`), functions (`function`), and classes (`class`) are conceptually 'moved' to the top of their containing scope (function scope for `var`/`function`, block scope for `let`/`const`/`class`) *before* the code execution begins.\n\nHowever, hoisting behavior differs for different types of declarations:\n\n1.  **`var` variables:** Only the *declaration* is hoisted, not the *initialization*. This means the variable is known to the scope from the start, but its value is `undefined` until the line where it's actually assigned a value is reached.\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined (declaration hoisted, but not assignment)\n    var myVar = 5;\n    console.log(myVar); // Output: 5 \n    ```\n\n2.  **`function` declarations:** Both the *declaration* and the *definition* (the function body) are hoisted. This allows you to call a function declared with the `function` keyword before its actual position in the code.\n    ```javascript\n    myFunc(); // Output: Hello!\n    \n    function myFunc() {\n        console.log(\"Hello!\");\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **`let` and `const` variables:** These declarations *are* hoisted to the top of their block scope, but they are not initialized. Accessing them before the line of declaration results in a `ReferenceError`. This period between the start of the scope and the declaration line is called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).\n    ```javascript\n    // console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization (TDZ)\n    let myLet = 10;\n    console.log(myLet); // Output: 10\n    ```\n\n4.  **`class` declarations:** Similar to `let` and `const`, class declarations are hoisted but remain uninitialized and within the TDZ until the declaration line.\n\nIn essence, hoisting is about how the JavaScript engine processes declarations during the compilation phase, making them available within their scope before the code execution actually reaches their physical location.",

    "output": "Callback Hell (also known as the 'Pyramid of Doom') refers to a situation in asynchronous JavaScript programming where multiple nested callback functions create code that is difficult to read, manage, and debug.

This allows chaining asynchronous calls in a flatter, more readable structure.\n2.  **Centralized Error Handling:** `.catch()` can be added at the end of the chain to handle any rejection (error) that occurs in any of the preceding Promises, simplifying error management.\n\nExample using Promises:\n```javascript\nasyncOperation1(data1)\n    .then(result1 => asyncOperation2(result1))\n    .then(result2 => asyncOperation3(result2))\n    .then(result3 => asyncOperation4(result3))\n    .then(result4 => {\n        console.log('Done!');\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n        // Handle any error from the chain\n        console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n    });\n```\nThis Promise chain is much more linear and easier to read and maintain compared to the nested callback structure.",

    "output": "Both `[]` (array literal notation) and `new Array()` can be used to create arrays in JavaScript, but they have some differences, especially when `new Array()` is called with a single numeric argument.\n\n1.  **Array Literal `[]`:**\n    *   Syntax: `let arr = [element1, element2, ...];` or `let emptyArr = [];`\n    *   Behavior: Creates a new array with the specified elements. If empty `[]` is used, it creates an empty array.\n    *   Concise and generally preferred for creating arrays with known elements or just an empty array.\n\n2.  **`new Array()` Constructor:**\n    *   Syntax: `let arr = new Array(element1, element2, ...);` or `let emptyArr = new Array();` or `let sizedArr = new Array(arrayLength);`\n    *   Behavior:\n        *   `new Array()`: Creates an empty array, same as `[]`.\n        *   `new Array(el1, el2, ...)`: Creates an array with the specified elements, same as `[el1, el2, ...]`.
        *   `new Array(numericLength)`: **This is the key difference.** When called with a single *numeric* argument, it creates an array with its `length` property set to that number, but the array has *no actual elements* (it contains 'empty slots'). It does *not* create an array filled with `undefined` or the number itself.\n            ```javascript\n            let arr1 = new Array(3); // Creates [<3 empty items>] -> length is 3, no elements\n            let arr2 = [3];        // Creates [3] -> length is 1, element is 3\n            ```\n\n**Preferred Way:**\nThe array literal notation `[]` is almost always preferred in modern JavaScript:\n*   **Readability:** It's more concise and less verbose.\n*   **Consistency:** Avoids the ambiguity and potential confusion caused by `new Array(numericLength)` behavior.\n*   **Performance:** Historically, literals could be slightly faster, although this is less significant in modern engines.\n\nUse `new Array(length)` only if you specifically need to create an array with a pre-defined length consisting of empty slots, which is relatively uncommon.",

It defines both the data (attributes/properties/fields) an object will hold and the behavior (methods) the object can perform.\n- **Implementation:** Contains the actual implementation code for methods and can have constructors to initialize object state.\n- **Instantiation:** Classes can be instantiated to create objects (e.g., `MyClass obj = new MyClass();`).\n- **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit implementation and properties from other classes (typically single inheritance for implementation, though multiple inheritance of interfaces is common).\n- **State:** Classes can hold state (instance variables).\n\n**Interface:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a *contract* or a *shape* that classes must adhere to. It specifies *what* methods and properties a class must have, but not *how* they are implemented (traditionally).\n- **Implementation:** Interfaces typically only contain method signatures (name, parameters, return type) and property names/types, without implementation code. (Note: Some modern languages like Java 8+ allow default methods in interfaces, blurring the lines slightly, but the primary purpose remains contractual).\n- **Instantiation:** Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly to create objects.\n- **Inheritance / Implementation:** Classes *implement* interfaces, promising to provide concrete implementations for all methods defined in the interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.\n- **State:** Interfaces traditionally cannot hold state (instance variables), though they might define constants.\n\n**Key Differences Summarized:**\n| Feature        | Class                             | Interface                           |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Purpose**    | Blueprint for objects (Data+Behavior) | Contract for classes (Behavior shape) |\n| **Implementation**| Contains method implementations   | Contains method signatures (mostly) |\n| **Instantiation**| Yes (creates objects)             | No                                  |\n| **Relationship**| Objects are *instances of* Classes | Classes *implement* Interfaces      |\n| **Inheritance**| Can inherit implementation (often single) | Can be implemented by many classes |\n| **State**      | Yes                               | No (traditionally)                  |\n\n**Use Case:** Use classes to define concrete object types with their logic.

    "output": "Generators in Python are a special type of iterable, similar to lists or tuples, but they generate their items one at a time and only when requested, rather than creating and storing the entire sequence in memory at once.\n\nThey are created using functions that contain one or more `yield` statements.\n\n**Key Characteristics & Differences:**\n\n1.  **Lazy Evaluation:** Generators produce values on-the-fly as needed (lazily). When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object (an iterator) but doesn't start execution immediately. The code runs only when the `next()` method is called on the generator object (often implicitly, like in a `for` loop).\n    *   *Contrast:* A regular function returning a list computes all values, builds the full list in memory, and then returns it.\n\n2.  **`yield` Keyword:** Instead of `return`, generator functions use `yield`. When `yield` is encountered, the function's state (local variables, instruction pointer) is paused, and the yielded value is returned to the caller. Upon the next call to `next()`, the function resumes execution immediately after the `yield` statement.\n    *   *Contrast:* `return` terminates the function execution entirely.\n\n3.  **Memory Efficiency:** Because generators produce items one by one, they are highly memory-efficient, especially for large sequences. They don't need to store the entire sequence in memory.\n    *   *Contrast:* Creating a large list can consume significant memory.\n\n4.  **State Suspension:** Generators maintain their internal state between calls. Local variables and the execution point are remembered.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\n# Generator Function\ndef count_up_to(n):\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        yield i\n        i += 1\n\n# Using the generator\ncounter = count_up_to(3)\nprint(type(counter)) # Output: <class 'generator'>\n\nprint(next(counter)) # Output: 1 (Code runs until yield i)\nprint(next(counter)) # Output: 2 (Code resumes, yields again)\nprint(next(counter)) # Output: 3 (Code resumes, yields again)\n# print(next(counter)) # Raises StopIteration\n\n# Can be used directly in a for loop\nfor number in count_up_to(3):\n    print(number) # Outputs 1, 2, 3\n\n# Regular Function returning a list\ndef count_up_to_list(n):\n    result = []\n    i = 1\n    while i <= n:\n        result.append(i)\n        i += 1\n    return result\n\nmy_list = count_up_to_list(1000000) # Creates a large list in memory\n```\n\n**Use Cases:** Ideal for working with large data streams, infinite sequences, or complex iterative processes where generating all items at once is impractical or unnecessary.",

    "input": "Explain the concept of Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with an example.",
    "output": "Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning \"many forms\") is a core OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. It enables you to treat objects of different types uniformly if they share a common interface or superclass.\n\nThere are two main types:\n\n1.  **Subtype Polymorphism (Runtime Polymorphism):** This is the most common form. It occurs when a superclass reference variable can hold an object of any of its subclasses. When a method is called on the superclass reference, the specific version of the method executed depends on the actual type of the object being referenced at runtime (method overriding).\n\n2.  **Ad-hoc Polymorphism (Compile-time Polymorphism):** Achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameter lists within the same class. The correct method is chosen at compile time based on the arguments provided.\n\n**Example (Subtype Polymorphism in Python):**\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement abstract method\")\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Meow!\"\n\nclass Duck(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Quack!\"\n\n# Function that works with any Animal object\ndef make_animal_speak(animal): \n    # The 'animal' parameter can hold Dog, Cat, or Duck objects\n    # The correct speak() method is called based on the actual object type\n    print(animal.speak()) \n\n# Create instances of different subclasses\nmy_dog = Dog()\nmy_cat = Cat()\nmy_duck = Duck()\n\n# Call the function with different Animal types\nmake_animal_speak(my_dog)  # Output: Woof!\nmake_animal_speak(my_cat)  # Output: Meow!\nmake_animal_speak(my_duck) # Output: Quack!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe `make_animal_speak` function takes an `animal` argument, typed conceptually as `Animal`. However, we can pass instances of `Dog`, `Cat`, or `Duck` to it. When `animal.speak()` is called inside the function, Python determines *at runtime* which specific `speak()` method to execute based on the actual class of the object (`my_dog`, `my_cat`, or `my_duck`). This ability to treat different objects uniformly through a common interface (`speak()` method) and have them behave according to their specific type is polymorphism.",

Show that calling the common method (`speak()`) on these different instances invokes the correct subclass-specific implementation.",

    "output": "Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n\n**How it works:**\n1.  When the function is called with certain inputs, it first checks if the result for these inputs is already stored in a cache (e.g., a dictionary or array).\n2.  If the result is found in the cache, it's returned immediately, avoiding redundant computation.\n3.  If the result is not in the cache, the function computes the result as usual.\n4.  Before returning the computed result, it's stored in the cache with the corresponding inputs as the key.\n\n**Optimizing Recursive Fibonacci:**\nThe naive recursive Fibonacci function (`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`) has exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times (e.g., `fib(3)` is calculated independently within `fib(5)` and `fib(4)`).\n\nMemoization can optimize this significantly:\n\n```python\n# Cache to store computed Fibonacci numbers\nfib_cache = {}\n\ndef fib_memoized(n):\n    # 1. Check if result for n is in cache\n    if n in fib_cache:\n        return fib_cache[n]\n        \n    # Base Cases\n    if n <= 1:\n        result = n\n    # Compute result if not in cache\n    else:\n        result = fib_memoized(n - 1) + fib_memoized(n - 2)\n        \n    # 4. Store computed result in cache before returning\n    fib_cache[n] = result\n    return result\n\n# Example Call:\n# print(fib_memoized(10)) \n# print(fib_memoized(50)) # Much faster than naive recursion\n```\n\n**Effect:**\nWith memoization, each Fibonacci number `fib(k)` (for `k` from 0 to `n`) is computed only *once*. Subsequent calls for the same `k` retrieve the result directly from `fib_cache`. This reduces the time complexity from exponential O(2^n) down to linear O(n), because there are `n+1` distinct values (0 to n) to compute, and each computation takes roughly constant time (excluding the recursive calls, which are now often cache hits).\nThe space complexity becomes O(n) due to the storage required for the cache and the recursion depth.",

    "output": "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex (a mutual exclusion lock) used in the standard CPython interpreter (the most common Python implementation) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode *at the same time* within a single process.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Only one thread can hold the GIL at any given moment.\n- A thread must acquire the GIL before it can execute Python bytecode.\n- After a fixed interval of execution (or when performing blocking I/O), the thread releases the GIL, allowing other threads a chance to acquire it.\n\n**Implications for Multi-threaded Python Programs:**\n\n1.  **CPU-Bound Tasks:** For programs performing purely CPU-intensive calculations (e.g., complex math, data processing entirely in Python), the GIL prevents true parallel execution on multi-core processors. Even if you have multiple cores and multiple threads, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This means threading provides concurrency (switching between tasks) but not true parallelism for CPU-bound Python code, often leading to little or no performance improvement (and sometimes even degradation due to overhead).\n\n2.  **I/O-Bound Tasks:** For programs that spend most of their time waiting for Input/Output operations (e.g., network requests, disk reads/writes, database queries), the GIL's impact is much less severe. When a thread performs a blocking I/O operation, it typically releases the GIL. This allows other threads to run and execute Python code while the first thread is waiting for I/O. Therefore, threading can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of I/O-bound applications by allowing I/O operations to overlap.\n\n3.  **Alternatives for Parallelism:** To achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in Python, the `multiprocessing` module is typically used. It bypasses the GIL by creating separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. Other alternatives include using different Python implementations (like Jython or IronPython that don't have a GIL) or using C extensions that release the GIL during long computations.\n\n**In Summary:** The GIL simplifies CPython's memory management but limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in multi-threaded programs. It's less of a bottleneck for I/O-bound tasks where threads release the GIL during waits.",

    "input": "What is REST? Explain the key principles and constraints of RESTful APIs.",
    "output": "REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services. It's not a protocol or standard, but a set of constraints that, when applied, lead to scalable, maintainable, and performant systems.\n\nRESTful APIs are APIs that adhere to the REST constraints. They typically operate over HTTP.\n\n**Key Principles/Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns. The client (e.g., browser, mobile app) handles the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage, business logic, and processing. They communicate over a network.\n\n2.  **Statelessness:** Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context (session state) between requests. Any session state is kept entirely on the client.\n    *   *Benefit:* Improves scalability (any server instance can handle any request), reliability (failure of one server doesn't affect others if state isn't stored), and visibility (request analysis is simpler).\n\n3.  **Cacheability:** Responses from the server should explicitly state whether they are cacheable or not. Caching on the client or intermediary servers can improve performance and reduce server load.\n\n4.  **Uniform Interface:** This is a key constraint that simplifies and decouples the architecture. It consists of several sub-constraints:\n    *   **Resource Identification:** Resources (e.g., a user, a product) are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), like `/users/123`.\n    *   **Resource Manipulation through Representations:** Clients interact with resources via their representations (commonly JSON or XML). The representation contains enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server.\n    *   **Self-descriptive Messages:** Each message (request/response) includes enough information to describe how to process it (e.g., using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and media types like `application/json`).\n    *   **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):** Representations should optionally include links (hypermedia controls) that guide the client on what actions they can take next. The client navigates the application state by following these links.\n\n5.  **Layered System:** The architecture can be composed of multiple layers (e.g., proxies, load balancers).

This allows for load balancing, caching, and security policies to be applied at different layers.\n\n6.  **Code on Demand (Optional):** Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (e.g., JavaScript).

    "output": "Bug Explanation:\nThe primary bug is an off-by-one error in the `for` loop condition: `i < n`. This causes the loop to stop when `i` reaches `n`, so the number `n` itself is never included in the string. To include `n`, the condition should be `i <= n`.\n\nA secondary potential issue is the space-adding condition `if (i < n - 1)`. While it works correctly with the original buggy loop condition, if the loop condition is fixed to `i <= n`, this space condition needs to be adjusted to `if (i < n)` to avoid adding a trailing space after the last number.\n\nCorrected Code (Option 1: Fixing Loop and Space Condition):\n```javascript\nfunction createNumberString(n) {\n  let result = \"\";\n  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Corrected loop condition\n    result += i;\n    if (i < n) { // Corrected space condition\n      result += \" \"; \n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nCorrected Code (Option 2: Using Array Join - Often Cleaner):\n```javascript\nfunction createNumberStringJoin(n) {\n  if (n < 1) return \"\";\n  const numbers = [];\n  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    numbers.push(i);\n  }\n  return numbers.join(' ');\n}\n```",

      "1. **Understand the Goal:** Generate a space-separated string of numbers from 1 up to and including `n`.",
      "2. **Analyze the Original Code:**\n   - A `for` loop runs with `let i = 1` and condition `i < n`.\n   - Inside, it appends `i` to `result`.\n   - It adds a space if `i < n - 1`.",
      "3. **Trace with Example (n=5):**\n   - `i = 1`: `1 < 5` true. `result = \"1\"`. `1 < 4` true. `result = \"1 \"`.\n   - `i = 2`: `2 < 5` true. `result = \"1 2\"`. `2 < 4` true. `result = \"1 2 \"`.\n   - `i = 3`: `3 < 5` true. `result = \"1 2 3\"`. `3 < 4` true. `result = \"1 2 3 \"`.\n   - `i = 4`: `4 < 5` true. `result = \"1 2 3 4\"`. `4 < 4` false. No space added.\n   - `i = 5`: `5 < 5` false. Loop terminates.",
      "4. **Identify the Error:** The trace shows the loop stops before processing `i = 5`. The condition `i < n` excludes the number `n` itself. This is an off-by-one error.",
      "5. **Formulate Fix 1 (Correcting Loop):** Change the loop condition to include `n`. The correct condition is `i <= n`.",
      "6. **Re-evaluate Space Condition:** With the loop running up to `i <= n`, the space condition `if (i < n - 1)` is now incorrect. It would miss the space after `n-1`. The condition should add a space after every number *except* the last one (`n`). So, the condition should be `if (i < n)`.",
      "7. **Formulate Fix 2 (Array Join):** A common and often cleaner pattern for building spaced strings is:\n   a. Create an array of the numbers.\n   b. Use the `join(' ')` method to create the string with spaces in between.\n   c. Implement this: loop from 1 to `n`, push `i` into an array, then return `array.join(' ')`.",
      "8. **Present Solutions:** Provide the directly corrected code and the alternative array-based solution, explaining the off-by-one error and the corresponding fix needed for the space addition."

    "output": "`map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are higher-order functions common in functional programming that operate on collections (like arrays) without modifying the original collection, promoting immutability.\n\n**1. `map()`**\n- **Purpose:** Transforms each element of an array into a new element based on a provided function, returning a *new array* of the transformed elements with the same length as the original.\n- **How it works:** It iterates through each element, applies a callback function to it, and collects the results in a new array.\n- **JavaScript Example:**\n  ```javascript\n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n  const squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);\n  // squares is [1, 4, 9, 16]\n  // numbers is still [1, 2, 3, 4]\n  ```\n\n**2. `filter()`**\n- **Purpose:** Creates a *new array* containing only the elements from the original array that satisfy a condition specified by a provided function (the callback function should return `true` or `false`).\n- **How it works:** It iterates through each element, applies a callback function (predicate) to it. If the callback returns `true`, the element is included in the new array.\n- **JavaScript Example:**\n  ```javascript\n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n  const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);\n  // evens is [2, 4, 6]\n  // numbers is still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n  ```\n\n**3. `reduce()`**\n- **Purpose:** Executes a 'reducer' function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It 'reduces' the array to one value (e.g., sum, product, accumulated object).\n- **How it works:** It takes a callback function (the reducer) and an optional initial value. The reducer function typically takes two arguments: an `accumulator` (the value accumulated so far) and the `currentValue` being processed. The return value of the reducer becomes the `accumulator` for the next iteration.\n- **JavaScript Example (Summing an array):**\n  ```javascript\n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n  const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {\n      return accumulator + currentValue;\n  }, 0); // 0 is the initial value for the accumulator\n  // sum is 10\n  // numbers is still [1, 2, 3, 4]\n  ```\n\n**Summary:**\n- `map`: Transform each element -> New array of same size.\n- `filter`: Select elements based on condition -> New array of smaller or equal size.\n- `reduce`: Combine all elements -> Single resulting value.",

    "output": "Duck typing is a concept in programming, particularly prevalent in dynamically-typed languages like Python, where the suitability of an object for a particular operation is determined by the presence of specific methods and properties (its behavior), rather than by its actual type or class inheritance.\n\nThe name comes from the phrase: \"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.\"\n\nIn essence, you don't care if an object *is* a specific type (e.g., a `Duck`), only that it *behaves* like one in the way you need (e.g., it has a `quack()` method).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nclass Duck:\n    def quack(self):\n        print(\"Quack!\")\n    def walk(self):\n        print(\"Walks like a duck.\")\n\nclass Person:\n    def quack(self):\n        print(\"I'm quacking like a duck!\")\n    def walk(self):\n        print(\"Walks like a person.\")\n\n# This function doesn't care about the actual type of 'thing'.\n# It only cares if 'thing' has a 'quack()' method.\ndef make_it_quack(thing):\n    # Attempt to call the quack method.\n    # This will work for any object that has this method.\n    try:\n        thing.quack()\n    except AttributeError:\n        print(f\"Object {thing} cannot quack.\")\n\n# Create instances\nd = Duck()\np = Person()\n\n# Call the function with different types of objects\nprint(\"Calling with Duck:\")\nmake_it_quack(d)\n# Output: Quack!\n\nprint(\"\\nCalling with Person:\")\nmake_it_quack(p) \n# Output: I'm quacking like a duck!\n\n# Example with an object that cannot quack\ns = \"a string\"\nprint(\"\\nCalling with String:\")\nmake_it_quack(s)\n# Output: Object a string cannot quack.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe `make_it_quack` function doesn't check if `thing` is an instance of `Duck` using `isinstance(thing, Duck)`. Instead, it just tries to call `thing.quack()`. Because both the `Duck` object `d` and the `Person` object `p` have a `quack()` method, the function works for both. The `Person` object is treated like a duck *in the context of quacking* because it exhibits the required behavior. This avoids rigid type checking and allows for more flexible and adaptable code.",

An algorithm described as O(n^2) will not grow faster than quadratically with input size, but it might perform better in some cases.\n2.  **Asymptotic Behavior:** It focuses on the performance as the input size becomes very large. Constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored because they become insignificant compared to the dominant term for large inputs.\n    *   Example: An algorithm taking `3n^2 + 5n + 100` operations is simplified to O(n^2) because n^2 dominates as n grows large.\n3.  **Input Size (n):** Performance is expressed as a function of the input size `n` (e.g., number of items in a list, number of nodes in a tree).\n\n**Common Big O Complexities (from fastest to slowest growth):**\n*   **O(1):** Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element by index).\n*   **O(log n):** Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).\n*   **O(n):** Linear time (e.g., iterating through a list once).\n*   **O(n log n):** Log-linear time (e.g., efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Heap Sort).\n*   **O(n^2):** Quadratic time (e.g., simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, nested loops comparing all pairs).\n*   **O(2^n):** Exponential time (e.g., naive recursive Fibonacci, some brute-force algorithms).\n*   **O(n!):** Factorial time (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem using brute-force permutations).\n\n**Why is it used?**\n*   **Algorithm Comparison:** Provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms for the same problem, independent of specific hardware, programming language, or minor implementation details.\n*   **Scalability Prediction:** Helps understand how an algorithm will perform as the input data grows, predicting potential bottlenecks.\n*   **Abstract Analysis:** Allows reasoning about algorithm efficiency at a high level without needing to run benchmarks for every scenario.",

    "input": "Explain the concept of database normalization (specifically 1NF, 2NF, 3NF). Why is it important?",
    "output": "Database normalization is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, well-structured tables and defining relationships between them.\n\nThe main goals are:\n*   Minimize redundant data (saving space and reducing inconsistencies).\n*   Minimize data modification issues (insertion, deletion, and update anomalies).\n*   Simplify queries and make the database structure clearer.\n\nNormalization is typically described in terms of normal forms (NF):\n\n1.  **First Normal Form (1NF):**\n    *   **Rule:** Each column in a table must contain only atomic (indivisible) values, and each column must have a unique name. There should be no repeating groups of columns.\n    *   **Violation Example:** A `PhoneNumber` column storing multiple phone numbers like \"555-1234, 555-5678\".\n    *   **Fix:** Create a separate related table for phone numbers or ensure each phone number is in a separate row associated with the primary key.\n\n2.  **Second Normal Form (2NF):**\n    *   **Prerequisite:** Must be in 1NF.\n    *   **Rule:** All non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the *entire* primary key. This applies mainly to tables with composite primary keys (keys made of multiple columns).\n    *   **Violation Example:** A table `OrderDetails(OrderID, ProductID, OrderDate, ProductName)` where `(OrderID, ProductID)` is the primary key. `OrderDate` depends only on `OrderID` (partial dependency), and `ProductName` depends only on `ProductID` (partial dependency).\n    *   **Fix:** Split into tables like `Orders(OrderID, OrderDate)`, `Products(ProductID, ProductName)`, and `OrderItems(OrderID, ProductID)`.\n\n3.  **Third Normal Form (3NF):**\n    *   **Prerequisite:** Must be in 2NF.\n    *   **Rule:** No non-key attribute should be transitively dependent on the primary key. This means non-key attributes should depend directly on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes.\n    *   **Violation Example:** A table `Employees(EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, DepartmentName)` where `EmployeeID` is the key. `DepartmentName` depends on `DepartmentID`, which in turn depends on `EmployeeID`. This is a transitive dependency.\n    *   **Fix:** Split into `Employees(EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID)` and `Departments(DepartmentID, DepartmentName)`.\n\n**Importance:**\nNormalization leads to databases that are less prone to data inconsistencies when data is updated or deleted (avoiding anomalies), are more space-efficient, and generally easier to maintain and query correctly. However, excessive normalization (beyond 3NF, like BCNF, 4NF, 5NF) can sometimes lead to overly complex structures with many tables, potentially impacting query performance due to the need for more joins. A balance (often 3NF) is typically sought.",

On average, this lookup takes constant time, regardless of the number of elements (`n`) in the set.
