    "answer": "An airplane wing (airfoil) is shaped so that air flows faster over the curved top surface than the flatter bottom surface. According to Bernoulli's principle, this faster-moving air exerts lower pressure. The higher pressure underneath the wing pushes it upward, generating lift. Deflecting air downwards also contributes via Newton's third law."
